# DoneWithIt

## Task-1

[Here](https://github.com/rishavraj221/DoneWithIt) is the code for a small app named MyLearningApp but its backend implementation is fake. So you need to make a new folder **Backend** which does these following things:

* **Stores Users:**  This Backend should store users data like their Name, UserId and password when the User register itself. It should remember the UserId so that another User can't access the same UserId. We will use post request to send data and get request to receive data when User LogIn...
* **Stores Uploads:** This app has a form which on submit should upload datas on database, User will fill images, Name, category, price & description in this form, we will use this data to fill the front screen...
* **Stores messages:** This app also has messaging feature, there is a form to write their message and a send button. So on the click of send, the data should be saved on the database and to which user is it sent, it will appeaer in messages section of that user...

After cloning don't forget to use command "npm i" to install all required dependencies...

That's it guys...
